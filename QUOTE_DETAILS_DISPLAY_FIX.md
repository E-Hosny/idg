# Quote Details Display Fix

## Problem Solved
The quote details page was not showing complete product information - only displaying "Product #123" instead of actual product names.

## Root Cause
The `ShowQuote.vue` component was receiving quote data but had no access to product information to display proper product names.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Controller Changes (`app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`)
- Modified `showQuote()` method to fetch product information from Qoyod API
- Added logic to filter products to only those used in the current quote
- Updated Inertia render to pass `products` array to the view
- Enhanced logging to track product count

### 2. View Component Changes (`resources/js/Pages/Dashboard/Quotes/ShowQuote.vue`)
- Added `products` prop to receive product data from controller
- Updated `getProductName()` method to look up actual product names from products array
- Enhanced product name display to show Arabic name first, fallback to English name
- Improved table structure with separate Product and Description columns
- Added product ID display for reference
- Fixed status badge to display proper translated status
- Updated translations for both English and Arabic

### 3. Enhanced Display Features
- **Product Names**: Now displays actual product names instead of just IDs
- **Better Layout**: Separated Product and Description into distinct columns  
- **Multilingual Support**: Shows Arabic product names when available
- **Detailed Information**: Shows product description, unit type, and product reference
- **Status Translation**: Properly translates quote status in both languages

## Testing
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Products data properly passed from controller
- ✅ Product names display correctly with Arabic/English fallback
- ✅ All quote details now visible including descriptions and unit types
- ✅ Status badges show proper translation

## Files Modified
1. `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php` - Enhanced data collection
2. `resources/js/Pages/Dashboard/Quotes/ShowQuote.vue` - Improved display logic

## Result
Users can now see complete quote details including:
- Full product names (Arabic/English)
- Product descriptions
- Unit types
- Proper status translations
- All quantities and pricing information

The quote details page now provides comprehensive information for proper quote management.
